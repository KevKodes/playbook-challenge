Technical Challenge Overview:

- We want you to make a simple note taking app, using any frameworks / languages
  that you would like (we prefer vanilla JavaScript)
- While you can use any framework / language that you want, please do not use
  any plugins that are note taking apps themselves
- if you need a simple plugin, like for fonts or icons or something minor,
  that is fine
- The data does not need to persist, so refreshing the page should refresh the app
- Ideally the project should take about an hour

Requirements:

- The user should be able to create new notes
- A note will be a simple text field (up to 255 characters), with an edit icon /
  button and a delete icon / button
- The user should be able to view a grid of notes (6x6)
- The user should be able to swap notes by clicking two of them
- When the user clicks a note, it should be outlined as selected, clicking a
  second note will swap notes with the outlined note. Clicking the same note
  will deselect it.
- The user should be able to delete notes by clicking the delete icon / button
  on each note
- The user should be able to edit notes by clicking the edit icon / button on
  each note.
